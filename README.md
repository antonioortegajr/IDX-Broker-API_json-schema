This repo is an attempt to create schema for the IDX Broker API.

This is NOT Official IDX Broker schema.

DO NOT contact IDX Broker support regarding this repo.

Pulls welcome.

This repo uses two validation scripts from https://github.com/jesstelford/jsonschemaphp

JsonSchema.php and JsonSchemaUndefined.php I didn't write these and they are great.

Intial schema was created online with this awesome tool: http://jsonschema.net/#/

Since everything in this API appears to be a string, regex is used a lot. However I do find a surprising amount of regex I would normally use doesn't really work. I will document the regex that seems to work for me. Again pulls are great.
