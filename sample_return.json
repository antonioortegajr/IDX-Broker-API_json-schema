The address actually exists and is home to a family named Parker: Andrew and Suzanne Parker, who moved there in 1974, and their two daughters. In 1989, the family began receiving junk mail addressed to Peter Parker. We got tons of it, Mrs. Parker said yesterday. Star Trek magazines, a Discover Card in his name, and notices from them over the years calling him a good customer. There were also prank phone calls, all of which she attributed to a teenager who found it funny that we had the same last name as Spider-Man.",
